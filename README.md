# M7011E

The project for M7011E 2022 by the group gamla och bittra; with Elliot Huber, Magnus Stenfelt, Peter Panduro and Tovah Parnes.
Our porject is a blog style website where we will make it using the frameworks NextJS and Dart and
then compare the performance of the two different systems. They will have a shared
backend and database so we can see the difference in them without other factors.
